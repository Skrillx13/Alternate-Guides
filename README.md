# Alternate Guides

**Welcome to Alternate Guides!**
Instead of a typicall wiki fasion style guide, this guide is a general use guide, with pages for mods, but more of a guide to game progress, and not just a site to "store" pages of information.

A set of game-guides done from the ground up for optimized user experience

Note: Alternate Guides is only for our Modpacks!

|Alternate world changes a lot of mod configs and crafting recipes, so if any mod guides are listed here, it is to be assumed the instructions in said guide only work for this pack (Unless stated otherwise). Please do not use the mod guides here as a standalone guide.|
