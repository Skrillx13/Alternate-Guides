# Welcome to Alternate Guides!

Instead of a typicall wiki fasion style guide, this guide is a general use guide, with pages for mods, but more of a guide to game progress, and not just a site to "store" pages of information.
 
???+ tip "This guide is only for our packs"

    Alternate world changes a lot of mod configs and crafting recipes, so if any mod guides are listed here, it is to be assumed the instructions in said guide only work for this pack (Unless stated otherwise). Please do not use the mod guides here as a standalone guide.

## Introduction

Welcome to a Kitchen-Sink Minecraft Modpack, with customized content and custom made questlines. Here you will find a guide on how to get started and play through our Modpacks. Some features include custom enchantments, weapons, ores, and customized mods made by our community and lead developers. Mod configs have also been edited to ensure that all the chosen mods are balanced (Mystical agriculture), and flow smoothly from early game to late game.
