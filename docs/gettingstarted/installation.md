# Installation

Our Modpacks can be installed through launchers. I assume you have at least one of the follwoing launchers: [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/download/app), [PolyMC](https://polymc.org/),  [Prism](https://prismlauncher.org/), [ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com/) or [GDLauncher](https://gdlauncher.com/en/). You will require one of these to download and run our packs. 

The installation varies for the launchers, but the process should be roughly the same. First, click the "Create instance" button, or something similar on your launcher. Choose to download from "Curse Forge", and scearch up our Modpack. Click install, and then press "play" to launch the installation.

???+ warning "Some launchers may not be able to fully download the Modpack"
    
    Certain launchers (Such as Prism) are unable to fully download the Modpack. You may get a warning to install mods manually. Simply head over to the Mod's Curse Forge website and download the file directly from there. (This is because Curse Forge blocks tools such as launchers from accessing their API)

## Setup

Upon loading up the instance, wait for the Modpack to fully load (This may take a while depending on your software)
